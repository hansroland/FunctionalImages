### Functional Images

This simple project tries to recreate the images from the paper of Eliott Conal: 
[Functional images](http://conal.net/papers/functional-images/).

Eliott used a Pan compiler to convert the Haskell code to real images.

In mean time, we have [JuicyPixels](https://github.com/Twinside/Juicy.Pixels) 
and [IHaskell](http://gibiansky.github.io/IHaskell/) notebooks, that allow to
display images.
