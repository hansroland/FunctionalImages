### Functional Images

This simple project tries to recreate the images from the paper of Eliott Conal: 
[Functional images](http://conal.net/papers/functional-images/).

Eliott used a Pan compiler to convert the Haskell code to visibles images.

Today, we can display images with [reflex-dom](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-dom)
